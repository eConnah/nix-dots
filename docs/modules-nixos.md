# NixOS Modules

## asahi

Configures the system for Apple Silicon hardware. Disables `kexec` and `fwupd`,
prevents EFI variable modification, configures lid switch behaviour, and
installs utilities like `asahi-bless` and `muvm`.

## aude

System-level user configuration for Aude. Defines user IDs, shell preferences,
and supplementary groups (including `wheel` and `la-famille`), whilst enabling
Tailscale and importing user-specific preservation and secret modules.

## aude-preservation

Configures impermanence state persistence specifically for Aude's home
directory, ensuring applications like Firefox, Spotify, Steam, and LibreOffice
retain their data across reboots.

## bootloader

A core module that enables initrd systemd and allows the bootloader to touch EFI
variables.

## connor

System-level user configuration for Connor. Defines user IDs, groups, and SSH
keys. Enables `pcscd`, `udev` rules for YubiKey personalisation, and Tailscale.

## connor-preservation

Configures impermanence state persistence specifically for Connor's home
directory, retaining data for tools like OBS Studio, Obsidian, Heroic, and
Steam.

## defaults

The foundational system profile. Defines baseline packages, fonts, Nix settings,
SSH, XDG defaults, Pipewire, and system-wide secrets management. Disables
NetworkManager in favour of explicit networking.

## ewan

System-level user configuration for Ewan. Defines user IDs and groups, enables
Tailscale, and authorises `ydotool` usage.

## ewan-preservation

Configures impermanence state persistence specifically for Ewan's home
directory, retaining data for applications like VS Code, Spotify, and Steam.

## hyprland

Enables the Hyprland desktop environment at the system level, including XWayland
support and UWSM integration.

## kyla

System-level user configuration for Kyla. Defines user IDs and groups, and
enables Tailscale routing features.

## kyla-preservation

Configures impermanence state persistence specifically for Kyla's home
directory, retaining data for Epic Games, Steam, and Obsidian.

## label

A simple module that sets the internal NixOS system label (currently set to
"separate-wallpapers").

## laptops

Configures power management and networking for portable devices. Sets up `iwd`
and `dhcpcd`, enables Bluetooth and power-profiles-daemon, and persists
networking state.

## leo

System-level user configuration for Leo. Defines user IDs, shell preferences,
and supplementary groups (including `networkmanager`).

## limine

Configures Limine as the system bootloader, integrating with the base bootloader
module and explicitly clearing default wallpapers.

## mesa

Enables 32-bit and 64-bit hardware graphics acceleration via Mesa.

## nvidia

Configures the system for Nvidia GPUs. Enables modesetting and the open-source
drivers, forces the XServer video driver to `nvidia`, and configures CUDA binary
caches.

## oledppuccin

Configures system-level theming, setting specific virtual terminal (VT) colours
and modifying the Limine bootloader interface branding.

## preservation

The core impermanence module. Maps critical system directories (Flatpak,
Tailscale, logs, SSH host keys) and standard user directories to a `/persistent`
volume, ensuring data survives ephemeral root wipes.

## secret-assertions

Validates `nix-secrets` configuration during evaluation. Ensures the host has a
valid recipient alias and asserts that it can decrypt all assigned secrets,
failing the build if unreadable secrets are present.

## substituters

Configures global Nix binary caches (Cachix) and their trusted public keys for
faster package fetching.
